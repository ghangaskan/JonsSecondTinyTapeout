## How it works

I set this up to celebrate the covenant of marriage I entered into with Angie 26 years ago. To do this I set up a mux rom with 32 data points (and then used just 24.)

to the love of my life, 
I have forged covenant 
into yet another precious substrate
It is everything and nothing
symbolic of the real thing
This has so far been the best half of my life.
